<b><h1><i>Kernel Density</i></h1></b>
<br>
Give a star if using this code :)
<b> The file Kernel_Density_2D.py is used to generate the following results</b>
1. The 1D Random Gaussian data is generated using Sigma1 * np.random.randn(500) + mean1
2. The capital ​ X ​ is assumed as a discrete value from the min of x to the max of x with a step count of
0.001.
3. The h values are iterated over the entire file.
4. For part 2 of the question, the x value generated is used in the Kernel density estimation formula.

This plot is generated when mean = 5 sigma = 1 and h = 0.1
<br>
<b>To get the next plots, we need to exit the generated plot.<b>

5. The histograms and the density plot can be generated by uncommenting two lines in the file.(Line 15 and 16)

6. The following graphs are generated after uncommenting the two lines.
